# Epic Games EOS Blocklist

**DISCLAIMER**: If the developers of the game you want to play decided to use EOS instead of Steamworks, its multiplayer feature will not work.

Based on [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594056744) Steam guide.* If you have any questions specific to EOS, please ask it on the Steam Guide, I just want to provide a .txt file.

> For those unaware, Epic is adding their own counterpart to Steamworks to more and more games, old and new, single or multiplayer and in many cases games that have been out for years have had EOS added retroactively.
> 
> While Epic markets Epic Online Services (EOS) as a "store agnostic" infrastructure for cross-platform multiplayer and achievements, games that have had EOS added retroactively like Killing Floor 2 and Remnant from the Ashes reported myriad connection issues for players after the updates in which EOS was added.
> 
> Epic also uses EOS to yet again collect telemetry on player IP addresses, hardware, gaming sessions (among others) in yet another way of involving themselves in games that, in some cases, are neither made with Unreal or even released on EGS.

For more info please refer to the Steam guide mentioned above.
